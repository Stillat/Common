Stillat Common
======

The `Stillat/Common` package contains features that are *common* to many different applications that developers build. This includes an improvement to PHP arrays, sorting algorithms and more.

This library is intended for use with Laravel 4.2 and above. Currently, there are no options for a standalone library.

## Docs

The docs will appear in the `Stillat/docs` repository located at https://github.com/Stillat/docs. This is done so all the `Stillat` packages are documented in one location, which makes it much easier for me.
